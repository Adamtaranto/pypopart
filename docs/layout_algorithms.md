| Simple connectivity | Circular | Shows connection patterns clearly |

## Algorithm Details

### 1. Hierarchical Layout

**Best for**: Fast previews, tree-like structures

**Speed**: ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ Fastest (0.14ms for 100 nodes)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐ Good for hierarchical data

**Description**: Arranges nodes in levels based on distance from a root node. Creates a tree-like structure that's easy to interpret.

**Advantages**:
- Extremely fast, works well for very large networks
- Clear hierarchical relationships
- Handles disconnected components

**Disadvantages**:
- May not show cyclical relationships well
- Layout depends on choice of root node

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'hierarchical',
    root_node='H1',      # Optional: specify root
    vertical=True,       # True = top-down, False = left-right
    width=2.0,          # Layout width
    height=2.0          # Layout height
)
```

### 2. Spectral Layout

**Best for**: Large networks (100-1000+ nodes)

**Speed**: ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Very fast (6.5ms for 100 nodes)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent structure preservation

**Description**: Uses eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to position nodes. Excellent balance of speed and quality for large networks.

**Advantages**:
- Much faster than force-directed or Kamada-Kawai
- Reveals clustering and community structure
- Good for networks with clear groups

**Disadvantages**:
- May produce less aesthetic layouts than force-directed
- Requires connected graph (handles disconnected with fallback)

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'spectral',
    scale=1.0,          # Scale factor
    center=(0.0, 0.0)   # Center position
)
```

### 3. Force-Directed (Spring) Layout

**Best for**: General purpose, medium networks

**Speed**: ⚡⚡⚡ Moderate (26ms for 100 nodes)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very good aesthetic quality

**Description**: Simulates physical springs between connected nodes. The default choice for most visualizations.

**Advantages**:
- Aesthetically pleasing layouts
- Works well for most network types
- Tunable with iterations parameter

**Disadvantages**:
- Slower than spectral or hierarchical
- Can be slow for large networks (>500 nodes)
- Non-deterministic without seed

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'spring',
    k=None,             # Optimal distance (None = auto)
    iterations=50,      # More = better quality but slower
    seed=42            # For reproducibility
)
```

**Tuning Tips**:
- Increase `iterations` for better quality (try 100-200)
- Decrease `k` to bring nodes closer together
- Use `seed` for consistent layouts across runs

### 4. Kamada-Kawai Layout

**Best for**: Small networks requiring highest quality

**Speed**: ⚡ Slow (187ms for 100 nodes)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Optimal quality

**Description**: Minimizes stress based on graph-theoretic distances. Produces optimal layouts but is computationally expensive.

**Advantages**:
- Highest quality layouts
- Respects graph distances precisely
- Deterministic results

**Disadvantages**:
- Very slow for networks >100 nodes
- O(N³) time complexity
- Not suitable for interactive use with large networks

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'kamada_kawai',
    scale=1.0,          # Scale factor
    center=(0.0, 0.0)   # Center position
)
```

**Warning**: Only use for small networks (<50 nodes) or when layout quality is absolutely critical.

### 5. Circular Layout

**Best for**: Showing connectivity patterns

**Speed**: ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ Very fast (0.16ms for 100 nodes)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐ Simple but effective

**Description**: Arranges nodes evenly spaced around a circle.

**Advantages**:
- Extremely fast
- Good for comparing edge densities
- Works well with node coloring

**Disadvantages**:
- Doesn't reflect graph structure
- Can be cluttered for dense networks

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'circular',
    scale=1.0,          # Radius of circle
    center=(0.0, 0.0)   # Center position
)
```

### 6. Radial Layout

**Best for**: Networks with clear central node

**Speed**: ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Fast (0.26ms for 100 nodes)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐ Good for star-like networks

**Description**: Places a central node at origin, others in concentric rings based on distance.

**Advantages**:
- Fast and intuitive
- Highlights central hub
- Shows distance from center clearly

**Disadvantages**:
- Works best for star-like topologies
- May be cluttered if many nodes at same distance

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'radial',
    center_node='H1',   # Node to place at center
    scale=1.0           # Scale factor
)
```

### 7. Geographic Layout

**Best for**: Spatially-referenced data

**Speed**: ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Fast (depends on projection)

**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Accurate spatial representation

**Description**: Positions nodes at their geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude).

**Advantages**:
- Shows true geographic distribution
- Can overlay on maps
- Reveals spatial patterns

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires coordinate metadata
- May not show network structure well if samples are clustered

**Requirements**: Metadata CSV with `latitude` and `longitude` columns

**Parameters**:
```python
layout = manager.compute_layout(
    'geographic',
    coordinates=coords_dict,  # {node_id: (lat, lon)}
    projection='mercator',    # 'mercator', 'platecarree', 'orthographic'
    jitter_amount=0.0        # Add noise to separate overlapping points
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Fast, Refine Later

For exploratory analysis:
1. Use **Hierarchical** for quick preview
2. Switch to **Force-Directed** for publication
3. Try **Spectral** if force-directed is too slow

### 2. Consider Network Properties

- **Clustered networks**: Use Spectral
- **Hierarchical networks**: Use Hierarchical
- **Star topologies**: Use Radial
- **Dense networks**: Use Circular or Spectral

### 3. Optimization Tips

**For large networks**:
- Reduce force-directed iterations: `iterations=30`
- Use spectral instead of force-directed
- Consider hierarchical for fastest results

**For highest quality**:
- Increase iterations: `iterations=100-200`
- Use Kamada-Kawai for small networks
- Set consistent seed for reproducibility

### 4. Interactive Workflows

```python
# Quick preview
layout = manager.compute_layout('hierarchical')

# If network is small (<100 nodes), upgrade to force-directed
if len(network.nodes) < 100:
    layout = manager.compute_layout('spring', iterations=100, seed=42)

# For large networks, use spectral
if len(network.nodes) > 500:
    layout = manager.compute_layout('spectral')
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Layout looks cluttered

**Problem**: Nodes overlap or edges cross excessively

**Solutions**:
- Increase iterations for force-directed: `iterations=100`
- Try spectral layout for better spacing
- Use radial or circular for clearer structure

### Layout is too slow

**Problem**: Layout computation takes too long

**Solutions**:
- Switch to spectral or hierarchical
- Reduce iterations: `iterations=30`
- Use hierarchical for instant preview

### Disconnected components overlap

**Problem**: Separate network components are positioned on top of each other

**Solutions**:
- Use force-directed or spectral (handle components automatically)
- Manually adjust with ManualLayout after initial computation

### Layout changes every time

**Problem**: Non-deterministic layouts make comparison difficult

**Solutions**:
- Set seed for force-directed: `seed=42`
- Use deterministic algorithms: Hierarchical, Kamada-Kawai, Circular, Radial

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Layouts

You can start with one algorithm and refine with another:

```python
# Start with fast hierarchical
initial = manager.compute_layout('hierarchical')

# Refine with force-directed (fewer iterations)
refined = manager.compute_layout('spring', iterations=30, pos=initial)
```

### Manual Adjustments

After automatic layout, use ManualLayout for fine-tuning:

```python
# Compute initial layout
positions = manager.compute_layout('spring')

# Create manual layout for adjustments
manual = ManualLayout(network, initial_positions=positions)

# Move a specific node
manual.set_position('H5', (1.0, 2.0))

# Get final positions
final = manual.compute()
```

### Saving and Loading Layouts

Save time by reusing layouts:

```python
# Compute and save
layout = manager.compute_layout('spring', iterations=200, seed=42)
manager.save_layout(layout, 'my_network_layout.json')

# Load later
layout = manager.load_layout('my_network_layout.json')
```

## Getting Help

If you're unsure which layout to use:

1. Try **Hierarchical** first - it's instant and often good enough
2. If that doesn't work well, try **Force-Directed** with default settings
3. For large networks (>500 nodes), use **Spectral**
4. For geographic data, use **Geographic** layout
