# Network Algorithms

PyPopART implements six algorithms for constructing haplotype networks. Each has different characteristics and is suited for different types of data.

## Algorithm Overview

| Algorithm | Complexity | Reticulation | Median Vectors | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| MST | Low | No | No | Initial exploration |
| MSN | Low-Medium | Yes | No | Alternative paths |
| TCS | Medium | Yes | No | Within-species |
| MJN | High | Yes | Yes | Comprehensive analysis |
| PN | Medium | Yes | No | General purpose |
| TSW | Medium | Yes | No | Distance preservation |

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Creates the simplest tree connecting all haplotypes with minimum total distance.

### Characteristics
- **Always produces a tree** (no cycles)
- **Deterministic** (same result each time)
- **Fast** computation
- **No reticulation** (alternative paths)

### Algorithm
1. Start with all haplotypes as separate components
2. Repeatedly add shortest edge that connects components
3. Stop when all haplotypes are connected

### When to Use
- Initial data exploration
- Small datasets (< 50 haplotypes)
- When tree structure is appropriate
- Quick preliminary analysis

### Python
```python
from pypopart.algorithms import MSTAlgorithm

algorithm = MSTAlgorithm()
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
```

### CLI
```bash
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a MST -o mst_network
```

### Limitations
- Ignores alternative equally parsimonious connections
- May oversimplify complex relationships
- Single path between haplotypes

## Minimum Spanning Network (MSN)

Extends MST by adding alternative connections of equal parsimony.

### Characteristics
- **Shows alternative paths**
- **Reticulation present**
- **Still relatively simple**
- **Fast computation**

### Algorithm
1. Build MST as foundation
2. Add edges creating cycles if distance equals shortest path
3. Remove redundant edges

### When to Use
- Want to see alternative evolutionary paths
- Data has ambiguous relationships
- Balance between simplicity and completeness
- Following MST analysis

### Python
```python
from pypopart.algorithms import MSNAlgorithm

algorithm = MSNAlgorithm()
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
```

### CLI
```bash
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a MSN -o msn_network
```

### Advantages over MST
- Shows multiple equally parsimonious paths
- More informative about uncertainty
- Still computationally efficient

## Statistical Parsimony (TCS)

Connects haplotypes within statistical parsimony limit (95% confidence by default).

### Characteristics
- **Statistically justified connections**
- **May produce disconnected networks**
- **No median vectors**
- **Confidence-based**

### Algorithm
1. Calculate maximum number of differences for connection (epsilon)
2. Connect haplotypes differing by ≤ epsilon mutations
3. Nested clade structure

### Parameters
- `epsilon`: Connection limit (default: 0.95 confidence)
- Calculated from alignment or specified

### When to Use
- Within-species variation
- Recent divergence
- Need statistical justification
- Population-level studies

### Python
```python
from pypopart.algorithms import TCSAlgorithm

# Default epsilon (95% confidence)
algorithm = TCSAlgorithm()
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)

# Custom epsilon
algorithm = TCSAlgorithm(epsilon=0.99)
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
```

### CLI
```bash
# Default
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a TCS -o tcs_network

# Custom epsilon
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a TCS --epsilon 0.99 -o tcs_network
```

### Considerations
- May produce multiple disconnected components
- Sensitive to epsilon parameter
- Assumes neutrality and panmixia

## Median-Joining Network (MJN)

Most comprehensive algorithm inferring ancestral haplotypes.

### Characteristics
- **Infers median vectors** (ancestral/unobserved haplotypes)
- **Shows reticulation**
- **Most complete**
- **Computationally intensive**

### Algorithm
1. Build MSN as starting point
2. Identify and add median vectors (consensus sequences)
3. Remove unnecessary edges
4. Iterate until stable

### When to Use
- Complex evolutionary scenarios
- Large datasets with structure
- Need ancestral sequence inference
- Publication-quality analysis

### Python
```python
from pypopart.algorithms import MJNAlgorithm

algorithm = MJNAlgorithm()
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
```

### CLI
```bash
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a MJN -o mjn_network
```

### Advantages
- Most informative
- Shows inferred ancestors
- Handles complex relationships
- Widely used in publications

### Limitations
- Computationally expensive
- Can be complex to interpret
- May overfit small datasets

## Parsimony Network (PN)

Consensus approach using multiple MSTs with different starting points.

### Characteristics
- **Consensus of multiple trees**
- **Shows reticulation**
- **Balanced complexity**
- **Robust to starting conditions**

### Algorithm
1. Build multiple MSTs with different starting haplotypes
2. Combine into consensus network
3. Keep connections appearing in multiple trees

### When to Use
- General purpose analysis
- Want robustness
- Balance between MSN and MJN
- Uncertain about best algorithm

### Python
```python
from pypopart.algorithms import ParsimonyNetAlgorithm

algorithm = ParsimonyNetAlgorithm()
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
```

### CLI
```bash
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a PN -o pn_network
```

## Tight Span Walker (TSW)

Metric-preserving network construction.

### Characteristics
- **Preserves distance relationships**
- **Metric space approach**
- **Mathematical rigor**
- **Moderate complexity**

### Algorithm
1. Compute tight span of distance matrix
2. Walk through tight span structure
3. Build network preserving distances

### When to Use
- Distance accuracy critical
- Mathematical rigor needed
- Metric properties important
- Complex distance patterns

### Python
```python
from pypopart.algorithms import TSWAlgorithm

algorithm = TSWAlgorithm()
network = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
```

### CLI
```bash
pypopart network sequences.fasta -a TSW -o tsw_network
```

## Comparing Algorithms

Run multiple algorithms on the same data:

```python
from pypopart import Alignment
from pypopart.algorithms import MSTAlgorithm, MSNAlgorithm, TCSAlgorithm, MJNAlgorithm

alignment = Alignment.from_fasta("sequences.fasta")

algorithms = {
    "MST": MSTAlgorithm(),
    "MSN": MSNAlgorithm(),
    "TCS": TCSAlgorithm(),
    "MJN": MJNAlgorithm(),
}

networks = {}
for name, algorithm in algorithms.items():
    networks[name] = algorithm.build_network(alignment)
    print(f"{name}: {networks[name].number_of_nodes()} nodes, {networks[name].number_of_edges()} edges")
```

CLI batch comparison:
```bash
for alg in MST MSN TCS MJN; do
    pypopart network sequences.fasta -a $alg -o comparison/${alg}_network
done
```

## Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Time (50 seqs) | Time (200 seqs) | Memory |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| MST | < 1s | < 5s | Low |
| MSN | < 2s | < 10s | Low |
| TCS | < 5s | < 30s | Medium |
| MJN | 10-30s | 2-5 min | High |
| PN | 5-10s | 30-60s | Medium |
| TSW | 5-15s | 30-90s | Medium |

*Times are approximate and depend on divergence level*

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Begin with MST for exploration
2. **Compare algorithms**: Run multiple to understand data
3. **Check assumptions**: Ensure algorithm matches data type
4. **Consider computational cost**: MJN great but slow
5. **Validate results**: Check if network makes biological sense
6. **Report parameters**: Document algorithm and settings used

## Common Issues

### "Network is disconnected"
- Normal for TCS with high divergence
- Increase epsilon or use different algorithm

### "Too many median vectors"
- MJN can generate many inferred nodes
- Normal for large, complex datasets
- Consider MSN or PN for simplicity

### "Computation too slow"
- MJN slow on large datasets
- Try MST/MSN first
- Consider sampling or filtering data
